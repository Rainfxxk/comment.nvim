# Comment.NVim
Conveniently add and delete comment in neovim

Now, this plugin is very simple, and maybe there are many bugs. 

Although I just write this repo for learning neovim and fun, I'm very happy that you can make issue or contribute.

## Install

for linux, if I'm currect, you can install this plugin by executing this command. you can replace * for any legal directory name.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Rainfxxk/comment.nvim.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/*/start/comment
```
